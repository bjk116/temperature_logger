To-Dos:
1)  One shot function that searchs entire database and erases corresponding lines
from the log file
2)  Good way for function for this one shot full file scan to log results
3)  Good way to display the database info and stats to the front end
4)  Cront tab - function that runs every 10 minutes to insert new temp
records and delets as well
